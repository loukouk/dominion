Bug Name:	Unchanging coins total from played cards
Bug ID:		0001
Severity:	High

BUG DESCRIPTION
Whenever a card is played which should affect the coin total, no changes to the coin total is made.
For example, say I play the minion card and choose the +2 coins effect, nothing happens.
After playing the card, the coin total is equal to the value of the cards that are in hand.
This effect is not restricted to the minion card only, but all cards affecting coin total.

POSSIBLE FIX
If we look into the playCard() function, we can see that updateCoins() is called following cardEffect().
In the updateCoins() function, the coins are reset to zero and then counted based on the cards in hand.
Furthermore, the bonus is added to this total.
This bonus represents the extra coins added from cards earlier in the turn.
If this variable was not to be updated correctly in cardEffect(), then we would see errors in calculating the total coins because the effects from played cards would be ignored.
