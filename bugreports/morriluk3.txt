Bug Name:	Card discarding itself too early
Bug ID:		0003
Severity:	Medium

BUG DESCRIPTION
By running my Steward unit test, there was a bug that always came up when choice1 = 3, and choice2 or choice3 was equal to the position of the Steward card in the player's hand.
Essentially, after inspecting the source code in cardEffect(), I noticed that the card was discarding itself.
This bug then propagated because another card in the hand would come fill that hole, and then be discarded as well by the regular discardCard() call in playCard().
Since Steward was already discard, it would discard something random and unexpected, resulting in errors.

POSSIBLE FIX
There are probably two main ways to fix this problem.
In both ways, there would need to be a check in the Steward card effect to see if it is discarding itself.
If it is, the first fix would be to either skip that discardCard() function call, or simply to make the whole cardEffect() function fail because of invalid arguments.
Another way would be to make a small loop that would ask the player for a valid card in hand to discard.
This way, a small mistake would not crash the program or put the player at a disadvantage in the game.
Note: There might be issues if the player has less than 3 cards in hand.
