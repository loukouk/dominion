Bug Name:	Low scoring when player has gardens
Bug ID:		0002
Severity:	High

BUG DESCRIPTION
At the end of the game, after either all provinces are depleted or if three other supply piles have been depleted, the score seems to sometimes be incorrectly calculated.
The score is sometimes a lower value of what it is supposed to be.
This results in players losing when they should be at the top of the standings.
Also, this error seems to occur only when the target player has garden(s) in his deck.

POSSIBLE FIX
The error should be in the scoreFor() function since the score is the element that is incorrectly calculated.
Since it only happens with garden cards, we can assume they are the ones being incorrectly calculated.
Errors could include improper rounding or incorrect counting of all cards in the hand, deck and discard.
